# Snyk Juice Shop

This is a vulnerable by design repository for demonstrating Snyk in the IDE. Do not deploy this application in production.

### A note on consistency

The example prompts below may result in different outputs if you're using a different model. Even the same model may return greatly different responses from time to time.

If you experience different results than the workshop leader, try using a more specific prompt. For example, you may prompt `Scan for vulnerabilities using Snyk` and the agent may run a Snyk Code scan instead of Snyk Open Source scan like you were expecting. On the follow up prompt try prompting `Scan for vulnerabilities in my open source dependencies using Snyk Open Source` instead.

## Setup - Prep the Environment

```
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/dylansnyk-org/juice-shop-workshop

# Install the Snyk CLI
npm install -g snyk
```
- AI-IDE like Cursor, or VS Code in Agent Mode 
  - In VS Code, search "Chat: Open Chat (Agent)"
- Snyk [IDE Extension](https://docs.snyk.io/cli-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-ide-plugins-and-extensions) installed
- Configure the [Snyk MCP Server](https://docs.snyk.io/cli-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations/snyk-cli/developer-guardrails-for-agentic-workflows/quickstart-guides-for-mcp) 

To test your setup, try the following prompt:

```
Using Snyk's MCP Server, scan the code for Open Source vulnerabilities.
```

## Level 1 - Accelerate understanding

Start with asking for more information around a particular recommended fix.

```
Assess the breakability of upgrading the multer dependency to fix it's critical severity vulnerability.
```

Assuming the response is positive, let's try fixing it.
```
Yes, proceed with the upgrade.
```

We can also use AI to help better understand SAST findings from Snyk. Let's start by running a SAST scan and asking for an explanation for one of the vulnerabilities.

```
Scan the code for SAST vulnerabilities.
```

```
Choose one of the SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the login.ts file and explain it to me.
```

## Level 2

Level 1 is also about interfacing with Snyk through natural language. In level 2, we want to seamlessly integrate into agentic workflows.

To automatically trigger Snyk scans, create a rule in your IDE with the following contents:

```
Always run Snyk Code scanning tool for new first party code generated.
If any security issues are found based on newly introduced or modified code or dependencies, attempt to fix the issues using the results context from Snyk.
Rescan the code after fixing the issues to ensure that the issues were fixed and that there are no newly introduced issues.
```

Now try fixing that SQL Injection.
```
Fix this SQL Injection issue.
```

Notice how Snyk Code is automatically invoked to verify that the fix is secure.

Let's see Snyk Code automatically scan for vulnerabilities in brand new code.
```
Add an API endpoint to this file that returns a list of users based on a given search term.
```

## Level 3

Now that we've added Snyk to our agentic workflow, let's use additional context to better prioritize and align to our internal security and AI policies. 

```
What is the security policy for this repo?
```
```
Which vulnerabilities do I need to fix for this Tier 3 application?
```

```
Create an AIBOM and check if it aligns to my company's AI Usage Policy.
```
